Group ICA software (MATLAB)

GIFT is an application supported by the NIH under grant 1RO1EB000840 to Dr. Vince Calhoun and Dr. Tulay Adali. It is a MATLAB toolbox which implements multiple algorithms for independent 
component analysis and blind source separation of group (and single subject) functional magnetic resonance imaging data. GIFT works on MATLAB R2008a and higher. Many ICA algorithms were 
generously contributedby Dr. Andrzej Cichocki. These are also available in Dr. Cichocki's ICALAB toolbox. For any question or comments please contact Vince Calhoun (vcalhoun@unm.edu) or 
Srinivas Rachakonda ( srachakonda@mrn.org ).

Please note that all the toolboxes in GIFT require only MATLAB and not dependent on additional MATLAB toolboxes like Image Processing, Signal Processing, etc. Basic GIFT analysis (without GUI) 
runs on MATLAB R13 and higher. GIFT GUI works on R2008a and higher.
